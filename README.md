# Hex-Word-Game-Computer
Word game inspired by New York Times Spelling Bee with additional functionality playable on your computer.

Open the project folder in an IDE like IntelliJ and run the Game.java file to experience the fun! You can also combine the project
with a script file in a service like Platypus to turn it into an application that does not require you to open IntelliJ to run.
